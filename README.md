# Web Democracy

Decentralized justice protocol adaptable to any service in Blockchain. 

Web Democracy is a protocol that judicially intervenes by empowering the holder who stakes then native token for being elegible to make decisions and enforce the rules of the community, rather than rely on the old legal system, which can be slow, corrupt and expensive. This can be used for everything from regulation of social media to self-governing networks of autonomous entities.
